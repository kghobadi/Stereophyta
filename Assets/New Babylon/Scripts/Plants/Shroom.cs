    //this is going to look and function like the mushroom from shroom shade forest
    //each one is its own 'seed' 
    //can pick it up off the ground at any time and it will stop growing and add to your materials inventory (left hand)
    //when 'planted' it has a very short life span
    //has no growth stages, just a growth speed
    //it's scale slowly increases (mainly on the y scale but also on the other 2)
    //when hit by rhythm of any kind (or by the player), releases spores
    //spores are just 2 sprites that float in the wind kinda sporadically
    //when a spore touches the ground it plants a new shrooms
    //spores float in random direction (almost like unused FC floating particles w smooth random movements)
    //that's that. 
    //they can grow on top of each other
    //watering them could make them grow slower :0
