Ah, we've made it. 
This trek used to be so easy for me.
But I am getting old now, Samita.
My joints are getting weak. 
My back is aching. 
There was once a time where I took no breaks. 
That was long ago. 
Now, I must rely on you, my young one. 
My lungs are failing me. 
We have come here for the Glowing Nettles. 
This is the last time I will be able to make this trip. 
From now on, I am counting on you to bring me these.
So that I may hold off the infection...
