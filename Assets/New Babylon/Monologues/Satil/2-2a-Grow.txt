Good, Samita.
Plant some of those piano seeds on the grid garden.
Then, grab the Watering Can by the well.
Watering your plants once a day will help them grow.
And when a plant grows, its sound changes.
By watering some plants more than others, you can craft a song.
When you run out of water, refill your can at the well.
