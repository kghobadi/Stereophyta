Ah, the brew is ready. Come, take a look. 
Do you smell that? 
That's the resin I've extracted from the Nettles. 
It will seep into my stomach and stretch upward. 
As it travels through me, it will cleanse the toxins. 
I learned this mixture from an old friend in the Napoa forest, just North of here. 
I took you there once when you were very small. 
As you were crawling through the shrubbery, you discovered your first patch of Drumshrooms. 
The look on your face was something to behold. 
You have never lost that sense of wonder. 
You instilled it in me, too.
