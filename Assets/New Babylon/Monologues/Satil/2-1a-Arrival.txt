I will need to rest soon...
But I have so much to teach you.
We must make up for lost time.
After these lessons, you can run free.
Pick up that sickle by those rocks.
Use it to cut down some piano plants by the trees.
When you cut the plants, seeds will fall from the branches.
Collect some piano seeds.
I will be waiting for you by the grid garden.
