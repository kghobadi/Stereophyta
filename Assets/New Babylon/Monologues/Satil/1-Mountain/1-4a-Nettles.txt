I’ve been here many times in the past months for the glowing nettles.
I think my health is failing.
I brought you here today, because I am too ill to make the journey again.
Every week, I hope you will make the journey to pick the glowing nettles.
You’ve never been this far from home.
I’ve kept you to myself, and I’ve spared you from so much.
You’ve never been this far away from home, child.
Here the wind is stronger and the plants sing louder.
Follow me to the canoe.
