Good, Samita. 
Now, why don't you plant some of those piano seeds on the grid garden. 
You can find the Watering Can by the well. 
Use it to help the plants grow. 
When a plant grows, its sound changes. 
A plant will only grow from watering once a day. 
By growing some plants more than others, you can craft a song. 
Oh, and remember to fill up the Can by visiting the well.
