Ah, the brew is ready. Come, take a look.
Do you smell that?
That's the resin I've extracted from the nettles.
It will seep into my stomach and stretch upward.
For a moment, the brew helps me find peace.
But I don't mean to worry you.
You may be quiet...
But I shouldn't underestimate you.
I've kept you to myself and spared you from so much.
Run free, but please don't stray too far.
In the morning, you can use the canoe.
But you should rest before you explore.
