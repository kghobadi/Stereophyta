Files are organized into three folders based on segments of the game

Each folder has monologue assets which are used in the WorldManager

Each monologue asset can use up to two text files
The first will be triggered and said once (marked with an 'a')
The second is a condensed version of the first
It will be triggered repeatedly after the first is said (marked with a 'c')
