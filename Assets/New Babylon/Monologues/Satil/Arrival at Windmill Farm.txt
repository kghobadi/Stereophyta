I will be brewing my mixtures by the campfire. 
Would you mind collecting the seeds surrounding the Sprite trees? 
You can bring them to me, or plant them yourself. 
Either way they need to be harvested before the plants perish. 
You can use the watering can by the well to grow them further. 
But be sure to fill it up periodically by returning to the well.
If there are overgrown plants, the sickle is by the rock just over there.
Please remember to sleep by pressing 'Z' if you start to feel tired.
