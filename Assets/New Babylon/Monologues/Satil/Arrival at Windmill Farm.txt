I will be brewing my mixtures by the campfire. 
Would you mind collecting the seeds surrounding the Sprite trees? 
You can bring them to me, or plant them yourself. 
Either way they need to be harvested before the plants perish. 
You can use the watering can by the well to grow them further. 
Then, if there are overgrown plants, you can find the sickle by the dock or the ax by the campfire to chop them down.
