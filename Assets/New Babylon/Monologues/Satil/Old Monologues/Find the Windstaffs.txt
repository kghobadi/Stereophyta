I hope you've rested. 
I've left three of our other windstaffs on the other islands. 
I want you to go get them and bring them back to me. 
From here, the Mountain points North. 
One windstaff is West, on Guitarland. 
One windstaff is East, between the shroom patches. 
One windstaff is North, beyond the Mountain, resting at the end of the Forest Grid. 
Come to me when you've found all four windstaffs.
